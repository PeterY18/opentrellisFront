                <p>When weâ€™re establishing a new business we have a range of questions about how to manage the funds that we have already accumulated, and how to best balance our future needs with the current needs of the business. Financial planning tailored for founders:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>401k rollovers when a founder is starting a business as a second career</li>
                    <li>Investing the proceeds from the sale of a business</li>
                    <li>Founders establishing benefit plans for themselves and their employees</li>
                    <li>Inventors licensing new products</li>

                <p>We cultivate strong relationships because we put the founder first. We develop customized investment portfolios so founders mitigate risk and diversify investable assets outside of the core business. We balance portfolios to help founders safely gain exposure across equities and fixed income asset classes, thus providing the security of liquidity. We also assist in simplifying and minimizing transaction costs, while also benefiting from leading international allocation algorithms.</p>
                <p>Through our partnership with Barrett Capital Management, we provide access to a leading Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) with over $70 million in Assets Under Management. Our wealth management services include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tax deferred investment vehicles such as IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs</li>
                    <li>Brokerage accounts</li>
                    <li>Trust accounts</li>
                    <li>Charitable accounts</li>
